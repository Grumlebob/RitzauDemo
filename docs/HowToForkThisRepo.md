# Fork This Repository

Use this page to choose the fork's identity, decide what to do with the sample feature, and enter the deployment guide for each target. For target capabilities and `DEPLOY_TARGETS`, start with the [deployment chooser](../Deployment/README.md).

## Choose the target route

- **One native Linux PC:** follow [LocalSingleNode setup](../Deployment/LocalSingleNode/AgentSetup.md) and [deployment](../Deployment/LocalSingleNode/HowToDeployLocalSingleNode.md).
- **Four prepared LocalCluster nodes:** follow [Fork onto an existing LocalCluster](../Deployment/LocalCluster/ForkExistingCluster.md).
- **New LocalCluster nodes:** follow [LocalCluster setup](../Deployment/LocalCluster/HowToDeployLocalCluster.md).
- **Cloud:** follow [Cloud setup](../Deployment/Cloud/HowToDeployCloud.md).

For a multi-target fork, keep all target folders and customize only the targets you enable. A clone intended to support only LocalSingleNode can remove the other targets by following [Single-node-only clone](../Deployment/LocalSingleNode/SingleNodeOnlyClone.md); deleting their folders alone leaves CI dependencies behind.

Before the first code PR, register an online self-hosted Linux x64 runner. Set repository variables `CI_RUNNER_LABEL` to its label and `CI_RUNNER_HOST` to its hostname. CI runs only on `CI_RUNNER_LABEL` and fails its runner check until both variables are set. Unset deployment labels fall back to template runners and can leave a fork's jobs queued indefinitely. Set `LOCALSINGLENODE_RUNNER_LABEL` or `LOCALCLUSTER_RUNNER_LABEL` for enabled targets. Use [AgentSetup `--ci-runner`](../Deployment/LocalSingleNode/AgentSetup.md) for a new single-node fork, or the existing-cluster route above for prepared LocalCluster nodes. Cloud CD requires an existing runner on `node-main`; Cloud setup does not install it.

Cloning this template does not grant access to another repository's runners.

## Choose shared identity

Choose these values once and use them consistently:

| Value | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_SLUG` | Lowercase deployment name; start with a letter and use only letters, numbers, and hyphens. |
| `APP_IDENTITY_NAME` | Usually the same as `APP_SLUG`; choose it before users exist because it scopes Data Protection and cache channels. |
| `GITHUB_OWNER` and `GITHUB_REPO` | The owner and repository name for the fork. |
| `APP_IMAGE` | Lowercase GHCR image owned by the fork. |
| `PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` | The hostname configured for the selected target. |
| `MIGRATION_BUNDLE_NAME` | Unique name for the fork's migration bundle. |

Update the first README paragraph and the local settings in `.env.example`, `GrumPlates/appsettings.json`, and `GrumPlates/appsettings.Docker.json`. Keep internal project and namespace names unless you are doing a planned rebrand. See [running locally](HowToRunLocally.md) for creating the ignored `.env` file.

## Frontend and sample feature

RitzauDemo supports one frontend: Blazor Auto. Keep `frontend-profile.txt` set to `BlazorAuto`. The Books CRUD example can stay while the fork is deployed, then be replaced in small slices using [How to add a feature](HowToAddANewFeature.md). Update the server, Blazor client, focused tests and documentation together when replacing it.

## Set shared release settings

Edit `Deployment/Common/release.yml` with the fork's `app_image`, `migration_bundle_name`, and the supported `linux-x64` migration runtime. Validate it with:

```bash
bash ./Deployment/Common/Scripts/validate-common-release.sh
```

Read the [release contract](../Deployment/Common/ReleaseContract.md) before choosing a commit to deploy. A pull request check validates the fork but does not publish a deployable release.

## Make and verify the fork changes

Make customization changes on a branch. Run the [local gate](Test.md#local-gate), open a pull request, and merge only after `build-test-push` succeeds on that exact head. Merging alone does not deploy; enter the selected target's guide after main CI publishes the release.

## Make a standalone product

When the fork becomes a product of its own rather than a configured copy, follow [Standalone product](StandaloneProduct.md). It orders target removal, the rename and template-material cleanup. If the clone keeps the template as an `upstream` remote, run `gh repo set-default <owner>/<repo>` first; otherwise `gh` acts on the template.
