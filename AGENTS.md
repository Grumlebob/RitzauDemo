# Agent working rules

Portable rules for people and coding agents working in this repository. Machine-specific paths, host names, IP addresses, keys and local permission preferences belong in your private agent configuration, never in tracked files.

## Plans

- Retained plans live in `Plans/` (tracked). Scratch notes go in `Plans.local/` (ignored).
- A plan-driven change is complete when it is verified on `origin/main` and applicable checks pass. Code/configuration changes require green exact-main CI; documentation-only changes use the exception below. Record the integrated commit and verification in the plan or the PR description.

## Changes and checks

- Code changes go through a pull request. The required check is `build-test-push`; merge only when it is green on the PR's exact head.
- Documentation-only changes (every changed file is ordinary `.md` or `.mdx` documentation; no source, build, workflow, deployment configuration, or other non-Markdown file) do not require local builds, format verification, tests, deployment gates, or waiting for PR/main CI. Review the complete PR diff, including both paths of renames, and run `git diff --check` before pushing. Use a PR for retained documentation changes. Add `[skip ci]` to documentation commits and the squash-merge title, then fetch and verify the integrated content on `origin/main`. A mixed PR uses the full code gate even if its last commit is documentation-only. Respect enforced GitHub protection; never weaken it or manufacture a passing check to use this exception.
- Before merging a PR that other open PRs use as their base, retarget them with `gh pr edit <n> --base main`; `--delete-branch` otherwise closes them.
- For changes that include code, configuration or other non-Markdown files, run the local gate before pushing; CI is not the first test run. The full list is in [docs/Test.md](docs/Test.md#local-gate). The short form:
  ```bash
  dotnet format GrumPlates.sln --verify-no-changes
  bash Scripts/CI/validate-frontend-profiles.sh /tmp/frontend-profile-results # needs Docker
  bash Deployment/Common/Scripts/audit-deployment.sh
  ```
- Keep `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` sequential in one checkout. Never run them at the same time against the same files.
- When you change behavior covered by the deployment audit (`Deployment/Common/Scripts/Component/lib/audit_deployment.py`), update the audit in the same change. Replace obsolete rules with checks for the supported single-node behavior; do not remove operational coverage.
- Rebuild and commit `GrumPlates/wwwroot/tailwind.css` when Razor classes or `GrumPlates.Client/Styles` change.
- Product requirements are in [docs/Requirements.md](docs/Requirements.md).
- Keep durable docs focused on current template behavior. Link canonical rules and commands instead of duplicating them; keep execution history in plans or PRs and use generic examples unless project-specific details explain template behavior.

## Hard stops

- Never run `docker volume prune`, `docker system prune`, or any unscoped prune on deployment hosts; never pass `--volumes` to Compose down on a node. Use the repository's scoped cleanup scripts.
- Never delete or reclaim a deployment lock automatically. Use `Deployment/Common/Scripts/release-deploy-lock.sh` after verifying the owner is gone.
- Never commit secrets, tokens, passwords, private keys, vault contents or real `.env` files.
- Never force-push `main` or rewrite history others have pulled.
- Never dispatch `CD - Deploy LocalSingleNode` without the operator's authorization.
- Stage explicit paths. Do not use `git add -A` or `git add .` for integration commits.
- Do not stash, reset or overwrite someone else's uncommitted work.

## Worktree closeout

- Closeout is part of task completion: fetch and prune, verify `origin/main`, then remove finished task checkouts and local/remote branches, including local branches whose upstream is gone once their content is on `main`. Preserve the primary checkout and `main` branch.
- Before cleanup, verify integrated or superseded content and no live task, process, lock, resource or open PR depends on it. Inspect tracked, untracked and ignored files; reconcile useful unmerged changes first. Squash merges require PR-head/content verification; ancestry or a closed PR alone is insufficient.
- Do not keep archives, bundles or evidence copies of finished work: record SHAs and outcomes in the plan or PR, then delete. Preserve private inputs, keys, application data, backups and other sessions' edits.
- Closeout also removes the Docker images, containers, Compose projects and volumes the task created, by ID or name and without force. Give them a task-specific name or label so they can be found. Keep what a later step or another task still uses.
- Record each deleted branch's full SHA in its plan or PR. Run `git worktree remove` from another checkout; resolve refusals without force or broad recursive deletion.
- Verified routine cleanup needs no additional approval, including finished tasks from earlier sessions. Fast-forward primary `main` when clean and idle. Report each retained task worktree with its concrete owner or dependency; age alone is not proof.
- Apply these checks to human, Claude, Codex and unknown-origin copies alike. Resolve routine leftovers using content, ownership and recovery proof; do not keep a completed generated workspace merely because its creator is unavailable. Preserve useful unfinished work compactly with a concrete next action when immediate integration is inappropriate.
- Unique work that is still useful is integrated, or recorded with a concrete next action; a recorded SHA is enough for squash-merged work. Historical diagnostic logs or screenshots with no remaining purpose may be removed after review. Preserve original user inputs, keys and operational data, and validate exact absolute paths and ancestor reparse boundaries before filesystem removal.
- Invoke scripts noninteractively and inspect background failures promptly. If an owned command unexpectedly enters a REPL or repeats an error, stop only that exact verified failed task and retain a bounded diagnostic sample. Do not leave failed log writers running or replace cleanup with another whole-checkout archive. The primary executor owns deletion/integration decisions; read-only inventory, comparison and drafts can be delegated.

- Inspect actual contents even under `bin`, `obj`, or `.venv`: these folders can contain original documents, private inputs, or editable package mappings. Preserve those inputs before discarding reproducible output.

## Shared deployment hosts

- A LocalSingleNode host can run several apps. Host-level services (Docker, Caddy, Avahi, and the deployment lock) are shared: change them only through the deployment scripts, and only remove resources you can prove this repository owns.
- Never hard-code a cluster value (node IPs, DNS suffix, domain, ports). Forks read them from their own `machines.yml`, inventory and settings.

## Setting up this machine as a deployment node

Only an explicit request to set up the current PC as a node triggers [LocalSingleNode AgentSetup](Deployment/LocalSingleNode/AgentSetup.md). A main-PC session discussing another node does not trigger setup. Reject Windows/WSL node bootstrap. The local agent follows that single runbook; the operator authenticates and runs its one sudo command.
